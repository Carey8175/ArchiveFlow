## SECTION 2 : EXECUTIVE SUMMARY / PAPER ABSTRACT
In an increasingly data-driven world, efficient and accessible information management is paramount for both businesses and individuals. ArchiveFlow, as a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, addresses this need by enhancing archiving processes through advanced document management and retrieval capabilities. This system combines retrieval and generation technologies to streamline the storage, classification, and retrieval of documents, aiming to reduce the time spent searching for information and improve overall productivity.

Our team designed ArchiveFlow with a modular architecture, incorporating both a front-end user interface and a robust back-end, developed using the Sanic framework, and supported by a Milvus vector database and MySQL for data management. The backend autonomously processes uploaded files by categorizing and indexing them using machine learning and pre-configured rules. By embedding documents with the BCE-embedding-base_v1(NetEase Open Source) model into a 768-dimensional vector space, ArchiveFlow enables rapid and accurate retrieval of relevant documents using Milvus, followed by reranking and context expansion to ensure comprehensive results. This two-stage search process optimizes the systemâ€™s speed and accuracy, significantly enhancing user experience.

To support high data loads, ArchiveFlow includes robust load balancing, user management, and permissions settings that ensure data security and scalability. Each user can create and manage personalized knowledge repositories, tailored to their specific information needs, allowing more efficient document organization and retrieval.

As ArchiveFlow evolves, future improvements may include more intelligent AI-driven classification, expanded cloud service integration, and customizable system configurations. We invite stakeholders to explore the potential of ArchiveFlow to meet their document management and retrieval needs, whether in small-scale personal applications or larger corporate environments.
